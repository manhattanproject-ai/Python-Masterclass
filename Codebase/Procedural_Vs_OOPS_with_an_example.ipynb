        "1. Focus:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Procedural: Focuses on actions/functions (add_book_procedural, borrow_book_procedural) and passing data to them. It's about how to do things step-by-step.\n",
        "* Object-Oriented: Focuses on objects (Book objects, Library object) that combine both data and the actions that operate on that data. It's about what things are and what they can do.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Handling:\n",
        "* Procedural: Data (library_books list) is often global or passed around between functions. Functions directly manipulate this shared data.\n",
        "* Object-Oriented: Data (like title, available_copies within a Book object) is encapsulated within the object itself. Methods (like borrow()) belong to the object and are responsible for modifying that object's own data. This makes it harder for unrelated parts of the code to accidentally mess with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Code Organization:\n",
        "* Procedural: Code is organized into procedures. If you want to know about borrowing, you find the borrow_book_procedural function.\n",
        "* Object-Oriented: Code is organized into classes and objects. If you want to know about borrowing a book, you look at the Book class and its borrow() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Modularity & Reusability:\n",
        "* Procedural: If you introduce a new type of item (e.g., a DVD) in the library, you might need to create many new functions like add_dvd_procedural, borrow_dvd_procedural, and modify existing ones to handle both books and DVDs.\n",
        "* Object-Oriented: You could create a new DVD class (perhaps inheriting from a general LibraryItem class). The Library object would then simply store LibraryItem objects, and each item would know how to borrow() or return() itself (polymorphism), making it easier to add new item types without changing much of the existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Procedural Programming is like having a central command center (the main program) that issues instructions to specialized workers (functions) on how to process raw materials (data).\n",
        "* Object-Oriented Programming is like designing \"smart packets\" (objects) that contain both their own data and the instructions on how they should be handled, then assembling a system out of these self-managing packets.\n",
        "* OOP generally scales better for complex, large-scale applications because it helps manage complexity through its principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Procedural programming can be perfectly fine for simpler, linear tasks."
