        "* Inside, you find a smaller doll, which you then need to \"open.\"\n",
        "* You keep doing the same action (\"open a doll\") on a smaller version of the problem until you reach the smallest doll, which you just set aside because there's nothing more to open.\n",
        "* A recursive function is a function that calls itself to solve a problem. It works by breaking down a big problem into smaller, identical sub-problems, until it reaches a very simple sub-problem that it can solve directly.\n",

        "\n",
        "* The Base Case: This is the stopping condition. It's the simplest version of the problem that the function knows how to solve without calling itself again (like the tiny innermost doll). Without a base case, the function would call itself endlessly, leading to an error.\n",
        "* The Recursive Step: This is where the function calls itself, but usually with a smaller or simpler version of the original problem (like opening the doll to find a smaller one).\n",

        "\n",
