        "# Build In Function Example in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, built-in functions are like the essential tools that come pre-packaged with the language. They are functions that are always available for you to use without having to do anything special (like importing them from a module).\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way: when you buy a new phone, it comes with essential apps already installed, like a calculator, a camera, or a web browser. You don't have to download or \"install\" these basic apps; they are just built-in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, Python comes with a set of fundamental functions that perform common and universal tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why do they exist?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Convenience: You don't have to write common operations (like printing text or calculating the length of something) from scratch every time.\n",
        "* Efficiency: They are often optimized (written in a lower-level language like C) to perform very fast.\n",
        "* Universality: They provide standard ways to do common things across all Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Always accessible: You don't need to use import to use them.\n",
        "* Perform common tasks: They handle operations that almost every program needs.\n",
        "* Fundamental: They are the basic building blocks of Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Examples of Built-in Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* print(): Displays output on the screen.\n",
        "* len(): Returns the number of items (length) in an object like a list, string, or tuple.\n",
        "* input(): Gets input from the user.\n",
        "* type(): Tells you the data type of a variable or value.\n",
        "* int(), str(), float(): Convert values from one data type to another.\n",
        "* sum(): Calculates the sum of numbers in an iterable (like a list).\n",
        "* max(), min(): Find the maximum or minimum value in a collection.\n",
        "* range(): Generates a sequence of numbers."
