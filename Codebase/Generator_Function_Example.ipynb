        "What is a Generator Function?\n",
        "Imagine you're watching a movie on a streaming service like Netflix. You don't download the entire movie onto your device before you start watching, right? Instead, Netflix sends you small chunks of the movie as you need them â€“ it streams data to you bit by bit. This way, your device doesn't need to store the whole movie in its memory at once, and you can start watching almost instantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Generator Function in Python works very similarly:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's a special type of function that doesn't return a single value and then exit.\n",
        "* Instead, it \"yields\" a sequence of values, one at a time, on demand.\n",
        "* When a generator function \"yields\" a value, it temporarily pauses its execution, remembers its state (where it left off), and sends that value back.\n",
        "* When you ask for the next value, the function resumes from where it paused and continues until it yields the next value or finishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key word that makes a function a generator is yield instead of return.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Use Generator Functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "The main benefits of generators stem from this \"on-demand\" behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Memory Efficiency (Lazy Evaluation): This is the biggest advantage. Generators don't build the entire sequence of values in memory all at once. They produce values only when explicitly requested. This is crucial for:\n",
        "   * Very large datasets that wouldn't fit into your computer's RAM.\n",
        "   * Reading huge files line by line.\n",
        "   * Processing an infinite sequence of data.\n",
        "* Performance: Because they don't consume memory upfront, they can be faster for certain operations, especially when you only need to process parts of a large sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleaner Code: They often make code that iterates over sequences much more readable and concise than traditional class-based iterators."
