    "# Higher Order Function\n",

    "What is a Higher-Order Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're managing a team of specialized workers. You don't do all the detailed work yourself, but you assign tasks to your team members based on their expertise. Sometimes, you even ask a team member to train someone new to do a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a Higher-Order Function is a function that either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Takes one or more other functions as arguments (inputs). (Like assigning a task to a specialist worker.)\n",
    "* Returns a function as its result. (Like training someone new, and then sending that newly trained worker back to the manager.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea here is that in Python (and many other modern programming languages), functions are \"first-class citizens.\" This means you can treat functions just like any other piece of data, such as numbers or strings. You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assign them to variables.\n",
    "* Pass them as arguments to other functions.\n",
    "* Return them from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Higher-Order Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generality and Flexibility: They allow you to write very generic code that can operate on different kinds of data transformations or logic without being tied to specific operations.\n",
    "* Code Reusability: You can write a single higher-order function that handles a common pattern (like applying something to every item in a list) and then plug in different \"action\" functions. This reduces repetitive code.\n",
    "* Abstraction: They help you abstract away the \"how\" and focus on the \"what.\" For example, map() abstracts the process of applying a function to every item, letting you focus on what transformation to apply."
