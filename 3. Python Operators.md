## Different Types of Operators

![Screenshot 2025-06-03 155742](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e865d092-8968-4e98-9e69-1afb2183a3b2)



Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.

### 1. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

-	= (Assign): x = 10
-	+= (Add and assign): x += 5 (same as x = x + 5)
-	-= (Subtract and assign): x -= 5 (same as x = x - 5)
-	*= (Multiply and assign): x *= 5 (same as x = x * 5)
-	/= (Divide and assign): x /= 5 (same as x = x / 5)
-	%= (Modulo and assign): x %= 5 (same as x = x % 5)
-	**= (Exponentiate and assign): x **= 2 (same as x = x ** 2)
-	//= (Floor divide and assign): x //= 2 (same as x = x // 2)


 ```py
# Assignment Operations in Python

# Simple Assignment
x = 10
print('Simple Assignment (x = 10):', x) # Output: Simple Assignment (x = 10): 10
# Addition Assignment (+=)
x = 10
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
print('Addition Assignment (x += 5):', x) # Output: Addition Assignment (x += 5): 15
# Subtraction Assignment (-=)
x = 10
x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x - 3
print('Subtraction Assignment (x -= 3):', x) # Output: Subtraction Assignment (x -= 3): 7
# Multiplication Assignment (*=)
x = 10
x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2
print('Multiplication Assignment (x *= 2):', x) # Output: Multiplication Assignment (x *= 2): 20
# Division Assignment (/=)
x = 10
x /= 4  # Equivalent to x = x / 4
print('Division Assignment (x /= 4):', x) # Output: Division Assignment (x /= 4): 2.5
# Floor Division Assignment (//=)
x = 10
x //= 3 # Equivalent to x = x // 3
print('Floor Division Assignment (x //= 3):', x) # Output: Floor Division Assignment (x //= 3): 3
# Modulus Assignment (%=)
x = 10
x %= 3  # Equivalent to x = x % 3
print('Modulus Assignment (x %= 3):', x) # Output: Modulus Assignment (x %= 3): 1
# Exponentiation Assignment (**=)
x = 2
x **= 3 # Equivalent to x = x ** 3
print('Exponentiation Assignment (x **= 3):', x) # Output: Exponentiation Assignment (x **= 3): 8
``` 


### 2. Arithmetic Operators:
Used to perform common mathematical operations.

- +(Addition): 5 + 3 gives 8
-	-(Subtraction): 5 - 3 gives 2
-	*(Multiplication): 5 * 3 gives 15
-	/(Division): 5 / 2 gives 2.5 (always returns a float)
-	%(Modulo): 5 % 2 gives 1 (remainder of division)
-	**(Exponentiation): 5 ** 2 gives 25 (5 raised to the power of 2)
-	//(Floor Division): 5 // 2 gives 2 (division that rounds down to the nearest whole number)


**Example:Integers**

```py
# Arithmetic Operations in Python
# Integers

print('Addition: ', 1 + 2)        # 3
print('Subtraction: ', 2 - 1)     # 1
print('Multiplication: ', 2 * 3)  # 6
print ('Division: ', 4 / 2)       # 2.0  Division in Python gives floating number
print('Division: ', 6 / 2)        # 3.0         
print('Division: ', 7 / 2)        # 3.5
print('Division without the remainder: ', 7 // 2)   # 3,  gives without the floating number or without the remaining
print ('Division without the remainder: ',7 // 3)   # 2
print('Modulus: ', 3 % 2)         # 1, Gives the remainder
print('Exponentiation: ', 2 ** 3) # 9 it means 2 * 2 * 2
```

**Example:Floats**

```py
# Floating numbers
print('Floating Point Number, PI', 3.14)
print('Floating Point Number, gravity', 9.81)
```

**Example:Complex numbers**

```py
# Complex numbers
print('Complex number: ', 1 + 1j)
print('Multiplying complex numbers: ',(1 + 1j) * (1 - 1j))
```

Let's declare a variable and assign a number data type. I am going to use single character variable but remember do not develop a habit of declaring such types of variables. Variable names should be all the time mnemonic.

**Example:**

```python
# Declaring the variable at the top first

a = 3 # a is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type
b = 2 # b is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type

# Arithmetic operations and assigning the result to a variable
total = a + b
diff = a - b
product = a * b
division = a / b
remainder = a % b
floor_division = a // b
exponential = a ** b

# I should have used sum instead of total but sum is a built-in function - try to avoid overriding built-in functions
print(total) # if you do not label your print with some string, you never know where the result is coming from
print('a + b = ', total)
print('a - b = ', diff)
print('a * b = ', product)
print('a / b = ', division)
print('a % b = ', remainder)
print('a // b = ', floor_division)
print('a ** b = ', exponential)
```

**Example:**

```py
print('== Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus ==')

# Declaring values and organizing them together
num_one = 3
num_two = 4

# Arithmetic operations
total = num_one + num_two
diff = num_two - num_one
product = num_one * num_two
div = num_two / num_one
remainder = num_two % num_one

# Printing values with label
print('total: ', total)
print('difference: ', diff)
print('product: ', product)
print('division: ', div)
print('remainder: ', remainder)
```

Let us start start connecting the dots and start making use of what we already know to calculate (area, volume,density,  weight, perimeter, distance, force).

**Example:**

```py
# Calculating area of a circle
radius = 10                                 # radius of a circle
area_of_circle = 3.14 * radius ** 2         # two * sign means exponent or power
print('Area of a circle:', area_of_circle)

# Calculating area of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 20
area_of_rectangle = length * width
print('Area of rectangle:', area_of_rectangle)

# Calculating a weight of an object
mass = 75
gravity = 9.81
weight = mass * gravity
print(weight, 'N')                         # Adding unit to the weight

# Calculate the density of a liquid
mass = 75 # in Kg
volume = 0.075 # in cubic meter
density = mass / volume # 1000 Kg/m^3

```

### 3. Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False).

-	(Equal to): 5 == 5 is True, 5 == 3 is False
-	(Not equal to): 5 != 3 is True
- (Greater than): 5 > 3 is True
- (Less than): 5 < 3 is False
-	(Greater than or equal to): 5 >= 5 is True
-	(Less than or equal to): 5 <= 3 is False


**Example: Comparison Operators**

```py
print(3 > 2)     # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 >= 2)    # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 < 2)     # False,  because 3 is greater than 2
print(2 < 3)     # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(2 <= 3)    # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(3 == 2)    # False, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(3 != 2)    # True, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(len('mango') == len('avocado'))  # False
print(len('mango') != len('avocado'))  # True
print(len('mango') < len('avocado'))   # True
print(len('milk') != len('meat'))      # False
print(len('milk') == len('meat'))      # True
print(len('tomato') == len('potato'))  # True
print(len('python') > len('dragon'))   # False


# Comparing something gives either a True or False

print('True == True: ', True == True)
print('True == False: ', True == False)
print('False == False:', False == False)
```

In addition to the above comparison operator Python uses:

- _is_: Returns true if both variables are the same object(x is y)
- _is not_: Returns true if both variables are not the same object(x is not y)
- _in_: Returns True if the queried list contains a certain item(x in y)
- _not in_: Returns True if the queried list doesn't have a certain item(x in y)

```py
print('1 is 1', 1 is 1)                   # True - because the data values are the same
print('1 is not 2', 1 is not 2)           # True - because 1 is not 2
print('A in Asabeneh', 'A' in 'Asabeneh') # True - A found in the string
print('B in Asabeneh', 'B' in 'Asabeneh') # False - there is no uppercase B
print('coding' in 'coding for all') # True - because coding for all has the word coding
print('a in an:', 'a' in 'an')      # True
print('4 is 2 ** 2:', 4 is 2 ** 2)   # True
```

### 4. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements

-	and: Returns True if both statements are true. (True and False is False)
- or: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true. (True or False is True)
- not: Reverses the result; returns False if the result is true, and vice versa. (not True is False)

**Example: Logical Operators**

```py
print(3 > 2 and 4 > 3) # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because the second statement is false
print(3 < 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because both statements are false
print('True and True: ', True and True)
print(3 > 2 or 4 > 3)  # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 or 4 < 3)  # True - because one of the statements is true
print(3 < 2 or 4 < 3)  # False - because both statements are false
print('True or False:', True or False)
print(not 3 > 2)     # False - because 3 > 2 is true, then not True gives False
print(not True)      # False - Negation, the not operator turns true to false
print(not False)     # True
print(not not True)  # True
print(not not False) # False

```

### 5. Identity Operators
Used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

-	is: Returns True if both variables point to the same object in memory.
- is not: Returns True if both variables point to different objects in memory.

**Example: Identity Operators**

```py
# Identity Operators in Python

# 'is' operator
# Checks if two variables refer to the *same object* in memory
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a # b now refers to the exact same list object as a
c = [1, 2, 3] # c is a new list object, even if its contents are identical to a
print('a = [1, 2, 3]')
print('b = a')
print('c = [1, 2, 3]')
print('\n"is" operator:')
print('Is a the same object as b? (a is b):', a is b) # True, because b points to the same memory location as a
print('Is a the same object as c? (a is c):', a is c) # False, because c is a distinct object in memory
print('Is b the same object as c? (b is c):', b is c) # False

# Example with integers and strings (due to Python's optimization)
x = 5
y = 5
z = 1000
w = 1000
print('\n"is" operator with integers and strings (Python optimization):')
print('Is x the same object as y? (x is y):', x is y) # True, for small integers, Python often interns them
print('Is z the same object as w? (z is w):', z is w) # Often False for larger integers, as Python might not intern them (implementation detail)
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "hello"
s3 = "Hello world!"
s4 = "Hello world!"
print('Is s1 the same object as s2? (s1 is s2):', s1 is s2) # True, short identical strings are often interned
print('Is s3 the same object as s4? (s3 is s4):', s3 is s4) # True (often for simple strings, though not guaranteed for longer ones)

# 'is not' operator
# Checks if two variables refer to *different objects* in memory
print('\n"is not" operator:')
print('Is a NOT the same object as c? (a is not c):', a is not c) # True, because a and c are different objects
print('Is x NOT the same object as z? (x is not z):', x is not z) # True

```
### 6. Membership Operators
Used to test if a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) contains a specific element

-	in: Returns True if a value is found in the sequence.
- not in: Returns True if a value is not found in the sequence.

**Example: Membership Operators**

```py
# Membership Operators in Python

# 'in' operator
# Checks if a value is present in a sequence (like a string, list, tuple, or set)
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
my_string = "Hello Python"
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
my_dictionary = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print('List:', my_list)
print('String:', my_string)
print('Tuple:', my_tuple)
print('Set:', my_set)
print('Dictionary:', my_dictionary)
print('\n"in" operator:')
print('Is 30 in my_list? (30 in my_list):', 30 in my_list)      # True
print('Is 60 in my_list? (60 in my_list):', 60 in my_list)      # False
print('Is "Python" in my_string? ("Python" in my_string):', "Python" in my_string) # True
print('Is "Java" in my_string? ("Java" in my_string):', "Java" in my_string)     # False
print('Is 3 in my_tuple? (3 in my_tuple):', 3 in my_tuple)      # True
print('Is 6 in my_tuple? (6 in my_tuple):', 6 in my_tuple)      # False
print('Is "banana" in my_set? ("banana" in my_set):', "banana" in my_set) # True
print('Is "grape" in my_set? ("grape" in my_set):', "grape" in my_set)   # False
# For dictionaries, 'in' checks for the presence of keys
print('Is "name" in my_dictionary? ("name" in my_dictionary):', "name" in my_dictionary) # True
print('Is "gender" in my_dictionary? ("gender" in my_dictionary):', "gender" in my_dictionary) # False
# To check for values in a dictionary, you'd use my_dictionary.values()
print('Is 30 in my_dictionary values? (30 in my_dictionary.values()):', 30 in my_dictionary.values()) # True

# 'not in' operator
# Checks if a value is NOT present in a sequence
print('\n"not in" operator:')
print('Is 60 not in my_list? (60 not in my_list):', 60 not in my_list)      # True
print('Is 30 not in my_list? (30 not in my_list):', 30 not in my_list)      # False
print('Is "Java" not in my_string? ("Java" not in my_string):', "Java" not in my_string) # True
print('Is "Python" not in my_string? ("Python" not in my_string):', "Python" not in my_string) # False
print('Is "grape" not in my_set? ("grape" not in my_set):', "grape" not in my_set) # True
print('Is "banana" not in my_set? ("banana" not in my_set):', "banana" not in my_set) # False

```

### 7. Bitwise Operators
Used to perform operations on individual bits of integers. These are typically used in lower-level programming, data compression, encryption, etc.

-	& (AND): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
- | (OR): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the bits is 1.
- ^ (XOR): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1.
- ~ (NOT): Inverts all the bits.
- (<< Left shift): Shifts bits to the left, adding zeros on the right.
- (>> Right shift): Shifts bits to the right, adding zeros on the left.

**Example: Bitwise Operators**

```py

# Bitwise Operators in Python
# These operators work on integers by treating them as sequences of binary digits (bits).
# Let's use two example integers and their binary representations:
# a = 10  (binary: 1010)
# b = 4   (binary: 0100)
a = 10
b = 4
print(f"a = {a} (binary: {bin(a)[2:]})")
print(f"b = {b} (binary: {bin(b)[2:]})")
print('\nBitwise AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1')
print(f'a & b ({a} & {b}):', a & b) # 0 (binary: 0000)
#   1010 (a)
# & 0100 (b)
# ------
#   0000 (0)
print('\nBitwise OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the bits is 1')
print(f'a | b ({a} | {b}):', a | b) # 14 (binary: 1110)
#   1010 (a)
# | 0100 (b)
# ------
#   1110 (14)
print('\nBitwise XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1 (exclusive OR)')
print(f'a ^ b ({a} ^ {b}):', a ^ b) # 14 (binary: 1110)
#   1010 (a)
# ^ 0100 (b)
# ------
#   1110 (14)
print('\nBitwise NOT (~): Inverts all bits (flips 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s)')
# Result is (-(x+1)) due to two's complement representation for negative numbers
print(f'~a (~{a}):', ~a) # -11
# Binary of 10: ...00001010
# Invert:       ...11110101 (which is -11 in two's complement)
print(f'~b (~{b}):', ~b) # -5
print('\nLeft Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left, filling with zeros on the right (multiplies by powers of 2)')
print(f'a << 1 ({a} << 1):', a << 1) # 20 (binary: 10100) - equivalent to 10 * 2^1
print(f'b << 2 ({b} << 2):', b << 2) # 16 (binary: 010000) - equivalent to 4 * 2^2
print('\nRight Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right, filling with sign bit (divides by powers of 2)')
print(f'a >> 1 ({a} >> 1):', a >> 1) # 5 (binary: 0101) - equivalent to 10 // 2^1
print(f'b >> 2 ({b} >> 2):', b >> 2) # 1 (binary: 0001) - equivalent to 4 // 2^2

```
