  <h1> Day 2 - Variables & Data Types

## 1. Variables

Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name (like x, y, z), but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended.

Python Variable Name Rules

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)
- Variable names cannot be Python keywords (reserved words)

Here are some example of valid variable names:

```shell
firstname
lastname
age
country
city
first_name
last_name
capital_city
_if # if we want to use reserved word as a variable
year_2021
year2021
current_year_2021
birth_year
num1
num2
```

Invalid variables names

```shell
first-name
first@name
first$name
num-1
1num
```

We will use standard Python variable naming style which has been adopted by many Python developers. Python developers use snake case(snake_case) variable naming convention. We use underscore character after each word for a variable containing more than one word(eg. first_name, last_name, engine_rotation_speed).  The example below is an example of standard naming of variables, underscore is required when the variable name is more than one word.

When we assign a certain data type to a variable, it is called variable declaration. For instance in the example below my first name is assigned to a variable first_name. The equal sign is an assignment operator. Assigning means storing data in the variable. The equal sign in Python is not equality as in Mathematics.

Let us use the _print()_ and _len()_ built-in functions. Print function takes unlimited number of arguments. An argument is a value which we can be passed or put inside the function parenthesis, see the example below.

**Example:**

```py
print('Hello, World!') # The text Hello, World! is an argument
print('Hello',',', 'World','!') # it can take multiple arguments, four arguments have been passed
print(len('Hello, World!')) # it takes only one argument
```

Let us print and also find the length of the variables declared at the top:

**Example:**


```py
# Printing the values stored in the variables

print('First name:', first_name)
print('First name length:', len(first_name))
print('Last name: ', last_name)
print('Last name length: ', len(last_name))
print('Country: ', country)
print('City: ', city)
print('Age: ', age)
print('Married: ', is_married)
print('Skills: ', skills)
print('Person information: ', person_info)
```

### Declaring Multiple Variable in a Line

Multiple variables can also be declared in one line:

**Example:**

```py
first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married = 'Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 'Helsink', 250, True

print(first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married)
print('First name:', first_name)
print('Last name: ', last_name)
print('Country: ', country)
print('Age: ', age)
print('Married: ', is_married)
```

Getting user input using the _input()_ built-in function. Let us assign the data we get from a user into first_name and age variables.
**Example:**

```py
first_name = input('What is your name: ')
age = input('How old are you? ')

print(first_name)
print(age)
```

## 2. Data Types

![Screenshot 2025-06-06 131013](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b35742b-93bd-4566-9c4f-8a2c7bdccce1)

Imagine you have different types of items you need to store and manage: numbers, pieces of paper with writing on them, or yes/no answers. You wouldn't store liquid in a flimsy paper bag, nor would you try to calculate the square root of a written sentence.

In the world of computers and programming, data types are essentially classifications that tell the computer (and other programmers) what kind of value a piece of data is, how it should be stored, and what operations can be performed on it.

## A. Declaring Data types

### int (Integer): Whole numbers, positive or negative, without a decimal point.
```py
age = 30
num_students = 150
print(type(age)) # Output: <class 'int'>
```
### float (Floating-Point Number): Numbers with a decimal point, representing real numbers
```py
price = 19.99
temperature = -2.5
pi = 3.14159
print(type(price)) # Output: <class 'float'>
```
### complex (Complex Number):Numbers with a real and an imaginary part (e.g., a + bj, where j is the imaginary unit). Less common in general programming, but used in scientific and engineering applications.
```py
z = 3 + 4j
print(type(z)) # Output: <class 'complex'>
```
### str (String):A sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols). Strings are immutable, meaning once created, their content cannot be changed.
```py
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello, World!'
address = "123 Main Street"
print(type(name)) # Output: <class 'str'>
```
### list:An ordered, changeable (mutable) collection of items. You can add, remove, or modify items after the list is created. Enclosed in square brackets [].
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
print(type(fruits)) # Output: <class 'list'>
```
### tuple: An ordered, unchangeable (immutable) collection of items. Once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements. Enclosed in parentheses ()
```py
coordinates = (10, 20)
days_of_week = ("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")
print(type(coordinates)) # Output: <class 'tuple'>
```
### range:Represents an immutable sequence of numbers, often used for looping a specific number of times. It's memory-efficient because it generates numbers on demand, rather than storing them all.
```py
numbers_up_to_5 = range(5) # Generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
print(type(numbers_up_to_5)) # Output: <class 'range'>
```
### dict (Dictionary):An unordered, changeable collection of data in "key-value" pairs. Each key must be unique, and it maps to a corresponding value. Enclosed in curly braces {}.
```py
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
contact_info = {"email": "bob@example.com", "phone": "555-1234"}
print(type(person)) # Output: <class 'dict'>
```
### set:An unordered, unindexed, changeable collection that does not allow duplicate members. Useful for mathematical set operations (union, intersection). Enclosed in curly braces {}
```py
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4} # Duplicates are automatically removed
print(unique_numbers) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
print(type(unique_numbers)) # Output: <class 'set'>
```
### frozenset:
```py
immutable_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
print(type(immutable_set)) # Output: <class 'frozenset'>
```
### bool (Boolean):Represents one of two values: True or False. Used for logical operations and conditional statements.
```py
is_active = True
has_permission = False
print(type(is_active)) # Output: <class 'bool'>
```
### NoneType (None): A special data type that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It's often used to initialize variables that will later hold a value, or as a default return from a function that doesn't explicitly return anything.
```py
result = None
print(type(result)) # Output: <class 'NoneType'>
```

## B. Checking Data types and Casting

- Check Data types: To check the data type of certain data/variable we use the _type_
  **Examples:**

```py
# Different python data types
# Let's declare variables with various data types

first_name = 'Asabeneh'     # str
last_name = 'Yetayeh'       # str
country = 'Finland'         # str
city= 'Helsinki'            # str
age = 250                   # int, it is not my real age, don't worry about it

# Printing out types
print(type('Asabeneh'))          # str
print(type(first_name))          # str
print(type(10))                  # int
print(type(3.14))                # float
print(type(1 + 1j))              # complex
print(type(True))                # bool
print(type([1, 2, 3, 4]))        # list
print(type({'name':'Asabeneh'})) # dict
print(type((1,2)))               # tuple
print(type(zip([1,2],[3,4])))    # zip
```

- Casting: Converting one data type to another data type. We use _int()_, _float()_, _str()_, _list_, _set_
  When we do arithmetic operations string numbers should be first converted to int or float otherwise it will return an error. If we concatenate a number with a string, the number should be first converted to a string. We will talk about concatenation in String section.

  **Examples:**

```py
# int to float
num_int = 10
print('num_int',num_int)         # 10
num_float = float(num_int)
print('num_float:', num_float)   # 10.0

# float to int
gravity = 9.81
print(int(gravity))             # 9

# int to str
num_int = 10
print(num_int)                  # 10
num_str = str(num_int)
print(num_str)                  # '10'

# str to int or float
num_str = '10.6'
num_float = float(num_str)
print('num_float', float(num_str))  # 10.6
num_int = int(num_float)
print('num_int', int(num_int))      # 10

# str to list
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
print(first_name)               # 'Asabeneh'
first_name_to_list = list(first_name)
print(first_name_to_list)            # ['A', 's', 'a', 'b', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'h']
```
